							Our History

						<div className="space-y-4">
							<p>
								Established in 2007, the fund began with an initial allocation of $100,000 from the college&apos;s
								endowment. Since then, our portfolio has grown significantly through both additional allocations
								and investment returns.
							</p>
							<p>
								Over the years, we&apos;ve expanded our investment strategy from primarily large-cap U.S. equities
								to include international stocks, fixed income securities, and ESG-focused investments.
