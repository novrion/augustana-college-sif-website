Stock pitches
- Click to get to actual specific pitch page from holdings.
- Make protected since this is sensitive information (update middleware for example)
- Make adding the stock pitch easier using symbol query and automatic fetching from finnhub stock api for company information (just input symbol)
- Add images and attachments to the stock pitches

Fix the home page!

Timing glitch under events:
- showing upcoming events in past tab (because they are for today)

Home page management (admin)
- Should be able to add one high quality picture + text for each section.

Custom Add and edit holding if stock api doesn't work

Portfolio page:
compare to S&P 500 (time needed and finnhub api call)
